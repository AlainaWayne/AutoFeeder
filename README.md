# Automatic Wet Food Feeder

![Project Image](link-to-image)

## Overview

The Automatic Wet Food Cat Feeder is an innovative solution to address the challenges of feeding cats on a wet food diet while the owner is away. It ensures precise portioning, maintains food freshness, and automates feeding schedules to provide convenience for pet owners and quality care for their pets.

This project was developed as part of the MECH 495 Senior Design Capstone at Kettering University.
